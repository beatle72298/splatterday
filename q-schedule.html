<span>The First Saturday of Each Month Is Always a “Throwdown:”</span> 
This is both a “Team Battle” (City vs City) and an Individual Tourney, with standard 10-minute chess games.<br><br>

<span>The Second Saturday of Each Month Is Always a “Blitz Tourney:”</span> 
This is both a “Team Battle” (City vs City) and an Individual Tourney, with very fast 5-minute chess games.<br><br>

<span>The Third Saturday of Each Month Is Always a “Throwdown:”</span>
This is both a “Team Battle” (City vs City) and an Individual Tourney, with standard 10-minute chess games. <br><br>

<span>The Fourth Saturday of Each Month Is Always a “Zany Tourney:”</span>
This is both a “Team Battle” (City vs City) and an Individual Tourney, playing a different crazy chess variant game each month such as “Horde” or “CrazyHouse.” These are 10-minute chess games.<br><br>

<span>The Fifth Saturday of Each Month (if there is one) Is Always a “Throwdown:”</span> 
This is both a “Team Battle” (City vs City) and an Individual Tourney, with standard 10-minute chess games.<br><br>

Each week, every point you score helps your team beat the other TKS cities, so even playing part of the hour helps your city, and each week, the top three scorers receives a rare yellow TKS shirt!
