<h1>Do the Top Three Placers Get the Rare TKS Yellow Shirt?
</h1>

<p class="small">Yes they do! When the tourney ends, if you are triumphantly displayed on the podium as one of the top three in the nation for that tourney, simply take a screenshot and email that to your City Coach and the yellow shirt will be delivered to you in your chess class soon thereafter. If you ever place in the top three a second time, then once you email your City Coach, at your next class you will receive ten pieces of candy/prizes, whichever your school usually does!
