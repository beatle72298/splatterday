<p class="small">Yes. Yes you can. Anyone who scores in the top ten of any Splatterday tournament earns one of the highest accolades bestowed by The Knight School. They are named a “Knight School National All-Star.”<br>

The parent of any All-Star may email a pic to Dr. Brooks at <a href="mailto:dbrooksphd@theknightschool.com">dbrooksphd@theknightschool.com</a> and the All-Star will see their shining face up on the Frame of Glory the following week. This is a fun way to view the people we routinely play and routinely chat with, so it makes Splatterdays all the more social! Newer pics are placed at the top.
