<p>Just click the Play button to get to our The Knight School private chess tourney room, and then click the green “join” button to start playing. The tourney begins when the countdown ends! 
<br><br>
For first-timers, and only for first timers, you will need to first go to <a href="https://lichess.org">www.lichess.org</a>. Don’t join; we did that for you. Simply sign in with the credentials our robot sent you when you enrolled. If you don’t remember them, ask in chat and the TKS Lifeguard will private message you your personal creds in the chat. Any trouble? Just ask in the chat!
