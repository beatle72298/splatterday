<h1>Who Is the Coach in Charge Today?
</h1>
<div class="grid">
<div class="col">
<p>The Knight School assigns one of its top coaches to act as “Lifeguard” each Splatterday. This way chat can be closely monitored, and anyone not being appropriate is removed. Every ten minutes the Lifeguard will also share some of the best jokes from the Varsity City-Wide classes across the USA. The Coach on duty will also field any questions from the kids or parents in the chat. Mainly, the lifeguard is there to ensure that the tourney and the chat flow smoothly and that all the kids are having a fun, social interaction while making new friends across the USA!
